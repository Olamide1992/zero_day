Hey, I am here again today. I get to learn the use of virtual environment.
Virtual Box is a virtual machine provider. The virtual machines themselves will be spawned using virtual Box.
Virtual Box is free and lightweight, which make it a perfect choice for us to use.

On the other hand, Vagrant is a tool that sits on top of a Virtual Machine (VM) provider. Vagrant is chosed because it's free, reliable and well maintained. The aim is to use virtual environment, and virtual box and vagrant arejust a means to achieve this purpose.
